                <dt>What is jQuery?</dt>
                    <dd>
                    <p>jQuery is an awesome JavaScript library</p>
                    </dd>

                <dt>Why should I use jQuery?</dt>
                    <dd>
                    <p>Because it's awesome and it makes writing
                    JavaScript faster and easier</p>
                    </dd>

                <dt>Why would I want to hide the answers to my
                questions?</dt>
                    <dd>
                    <p>To make it easier to view a list of available
                    questions - then you simply click to see the answer
                    you're interested in reading.</p>
                   </dd>

                <dt>What if my answers were a lot longer and more
                complicated than these examples?</dt>
                    <dd>
                    <p>The great thing about the &lt;dd&gt;
                    element is that it's a block level element
                    that can contain lots of other elements.</p>
                    <p>That means your answer could contain an ol or ul list, or almost any other HTML tags.</p>
                    </dd>

                <dt>What if my page has long answers?</dt>
                    <dd>
                    <p>If your FAQ page has long answers,
                    it might be helpful to put a table of contents
                    list of links to individual questions at the top
                    of the page so users can click it to jump directly
                    to the question and answer they're interested in.
                    </p>
